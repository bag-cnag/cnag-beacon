##What it is
CNAG-beacon within the FP7 project RD-Connect collaborates with Beacon Network (formerly known as the Beacon of Beacons, or BoB, for short) which provide an unified REST API to publicly available GA4GH Beacons (see <http://ga4gh.org/#/beacon> for more details about the Beacon project itself). Beacon Network standardizes the way beacons are accessed and aggregates their results, thus addressing one of the missing parts of the Beacon project itself.
